# Airplane seat exchange

Java app that lets you choose your flight and enter your seats. Then it looks for possible exchanges with other users and eventually notifies users who can exchange their seats so they can sit together with their companions. 

## Motivation

I wanted to try working with databases and apply the theoretical knowledge from school.

## Current functionality
* You can register new account
* After login, you can change your email, password or delete your account
* You can select the start/destination country and city. Then you get to choose a flight from a list based on your previous choice

## TODO
* Hash passwords
* Add seats functionality
* Algorithm to find seat exchange possibilities
